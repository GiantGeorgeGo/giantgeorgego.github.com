title: Valgrind for Android Native development
---


[Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that   
can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and  profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

As now there is amount of developpers for NDK development in the filed which:  
<i>  
1. Squeeze extra performance out of a device for computationally intensive applications like games or physics simulations.   
2. Reuse your own or other developers' C or C++ libraries.
